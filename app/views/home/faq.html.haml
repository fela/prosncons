  #### What topics are allowed? ####

  All questions should be about politics and public policy.

  #### What about other topics, like product comparisons, everyday decisions, programming choices? ####

  For now they are not allowed. If there is interest sections to discuss other topics will be created in the future. I think it is a good idea to keep topics separated to allow each one to create a community. In this early stage I prefer to concentrate on one topic.

  #### What kind of questions should be asked? ####

  The questions should offer a binary choise between two options.

  #### What if there are more than two choices? ####

  Compare two choices, whose comparisons is interesting. More questions can be created to compare different choices.

  #### What are examples of valid questions? ####

  What are reasons to believe and not to believe in antropogenic global warming?

  Good reasons to act and to not to act to prevent global warming? *(a different question that the previous one)*

  Obama vs Romney, who should I vote and why?

  Obama's administration, what did he do well and what not?

  #### What are examples of invalid questions? ####

  Unix or Linux which is a better operating system? *(Not about public policy, a better question would be: pros and cons of using linux in the public amministration)*

  What are the most effective measures to decrease crime rates in New York? *(Not a binary question)*

  Each answer should contain a reason to prefer one of the two options. Each answer should contain only one reason. Write more answers answers if he wants to suggest more arguments in favour of a given choice.

  #### Are duplicate questions allowed? ####

  It is preferable to edit the original question.

  Philosophy
  ----------

  #### What is the goal of this website? ####

  The goal of the website is to collaboratively create and share summaries of pros and cons on controvertial issues. The aim is not to give a conclusive answer, or to steer the user to any specific view, but rather to offer a starting point from where to further analize a topic.

  #### With what state of mind should I write answers? ####

  Try to be as humble as possible. If you tend to believe in one thing, try to concentrate on arguments against it. Your aim should not be to try to convince the reader, but mearily to provide information and ideas.

  #### Who owns what I write on the website? ####

  All content is licenced under the permissive Creative Common CC BY licence. Which means anybody can reuse the content as long as the original auther is properly quoted.

  #### Isn't it unfair to give pros and cons always the same weight? ####

  It is not the aim of this website to directly decide if pros or cons deserve more weight. It should therefore be the users burden to carefully analize the poinst and decide if one side of the issue has beter and many convincing arguments, or if one argument is so important that it overshadows all those on for the opposing view. Looking for arguments on both side is a good habit, and doesn't mean the conclusion cannot be havily favor one side.

  #### Is there a risk of users strategically voting up for bad arguments arguing for the view they don't agree on? ####

  If is important that a healty and honest community forms where the vast mayority votes honestly.

  While it is hard to really prevent bad arguments to purposefully be voted up, if people really thing their view is objectively better, then it is only in their best interest to give honest and correct information. Voting up bad argument will decrease the quality of the answers and decrease the websit's usefulness for everybody. If it really becomes a problem, effort will be made to block abusing users. Hopefully this will never become necessary.
