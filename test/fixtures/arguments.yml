  summary: granularity
  description:
    More granularity is encouraged, as there is not one correct answer,
    but rather an ordered list of
    claims. There is therefore more control regarding which pieces of
    information get voted up or down.

  option: pros
  summary: more robust to polarization
  description: The standard Q&A format doesn't work well when strong opinions are
    involved. In such a case voting of a claim is often only driven by
    whether it goes for or agains one's preference. When splitting the claims
    in two categories, those for and those against the initial statement, the effect of this polarization
    is likely reduced, and it will be only the **relative** ordering inside
    the lists that will matter.

page1arg4:
  option: cons
  summary: hard to describe complex interrelations
  description: Often the whole is more that the sum of the parts, so a
    topic might require a complex answer which cannot easily be split into
    single statements that have value on their own.
